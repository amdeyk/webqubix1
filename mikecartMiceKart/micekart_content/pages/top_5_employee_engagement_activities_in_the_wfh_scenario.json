    "This is the time for ice-breaking on many relatable issues. For starters, you may ask them to show what kind of tea or coffee they are brewing that evening. Far more relaxing discussions during thevirtual session,can be about how they are managing these monotonous times if someone is a new cook in their house, whether they are engaged in household chores, or even whether they are doing anything new and innovative.",
