In case you want to break the chain of regular banters amongst a few employees, organizingvirtual eventslike Juke Box and Simon Says where the shyest employee takes the lead. It can be a healthy start for goodteam bonding.",

Perhaps participation in suchteam bondingevents can be refreshing and build a solid bond amongst the employees.",
    "For an organization to succeed, the teams must be in sync.
