Things To Do
![](https://micekart-upload-files-new.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/PACKAGE_PLACES_IMG/Phi Phi Island1582787098890.jpg)
Phi Phi Island
The Phi Phi Islands are Thailand's superstar archipelago, particularly famous for Maya Bay's central role in the 2000 movie The Beach. It's the topic of conversation for travellers all over Thailand. Phi Phi's beauty is a large chunk of the allure. The islands, when approached by boat, rise from the sea like a fortress. 
![](https://micekart-upload-files-new.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/PACKAGE_PLACES_IMG/Bangla Road1582787189009.jpg)
Bangla Road
There are few things in this world to prepare you for an after-dark stroll down Patong's Bangla Road. The biggest collection of nightclubs, bars, shows and general nocturnal fun in Phuket, it's pretty much an all-out assault on the senses. In spite of this, it is still very much one of the essential things to do in Phuket, even if it's just to say that you have. 
![](https://micekart-upload-files-new.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/PACKAGE_PLACES_IMG/Big Buddha Phuket1582787274940.jpg)
Big Buddha Phuket
Visible from most of the south of Phuket, the Big Buddha sits atop the Nakkerd Hills and looks down over Chalong, Kata and Rawai. The drive up to the Big Buddha takes you through some beautiful jungle and the view from the top is enhanced if you take a map to identify the many, many sights. 
![](https://micekart-upload-files-new.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/PACKAGE_PLACES_IMG/Similan Island1582787552542.jpg)
Similan Island
The stunning Similan Islands are surrounded by amazingly clear blue seas and pristine white-sand beaches. Heaven for island-hoppers and scuba divers, the 9 islands are about 30 km off the coast of Khaolak. They're ranked among the best dive sites in the world for their lively and colourful coral reefs and perfect visibility. 
![](https://micekart-upload-files-new.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/PACKAGE_PLACES_IMG/phang nga bay1582786967021.jpg)
Phang Nga Bay
Phang Nga Bay is unique. A day out here is an unforgettable experience that will definitely get you thinking. A distinctive feature of the bay is the sheer limestone cliffs that jut vertically out of the emerald-green waters. These islands are home to sheltered fauna that are possible to observe on certain tours. James Bond Island and Koh Panyee are just 2 of the more famous spots in this bay.

Koh Tup & Koh Mor
The popularity of Koh Tup and Koh Mor is due to their specific shape. They are linked by a sandbar which also leads to Koh Kai, a third island, at low tide. Apart from this unique walk, and from the excellent snorkelling opportunities, there’s not much to do here. There’s just a short hike to Koh Tup's summit which offers a cool viewpoint to the other islands around.
