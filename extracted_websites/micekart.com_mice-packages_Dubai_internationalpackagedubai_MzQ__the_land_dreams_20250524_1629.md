Overview of Dubai
Dubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates known for luxury shopping, ultra modern architecture and a lively nightlife
scene. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, dominates the skyscraper-filled skyline. On man-made islands just offshore is Atlantis, the Palm, a resort with water and marine-animal parks.
Climate :- Moderate climate is found between October and March when days are sunny and pleasant (Average Temperature -
26 C). Nights are Cool (average temperature is 15 C) Summer is between April and September,
Best time to visit :- The best time to visit Dubai is from October to April. Weather-wise, Dubai really only experiences two seasons: hot and hotter. During the winter months, the city sees blue skies and primo beach weather. However, this is also peak tourist season, so expect plenty of company on Jumeirah Beach. You can escape the crowds if you visit during the summer months, but be prepared for triple-digit temps and high humidity levels.
