Tree of Life
The Tree of Life in Bahrain is a 9.75 meters high Prosopis cineraria tree that is over 400 years old. It is on a hill in a barren area of the Arabian Desert, 2 kilometres from Jebel Dukkha, the highest point in Bahrain, and 40 kilometres from Manama, the nearest city. It is not certain how the tree survives. Bahrain has little to no rain throughout the year. Its roots are 50 meters deep, which may be enough to reach the water source. Others say the tree has learned to extract moisture from grains of sand. Some assert that the tree is protected by Enki, a god of water in Babylonian and Sumerian religion Others claim that the tree is standing in what was once the Garden of Eden, and so has a more mystical source of water.

Before the introduction of cars to the country camels were the primary means of transport for the people of Bahrain, as they are ideal to travel distances in the humid and dry climate. However, their numbers dwindled as other methods of transport became more practical, hence why the Sheik decide to create the Royal Camel Farm to protect the native species of the Arabian Peninsula.
